# ðŸ’¤ LazyVim

A starter template for [LazyVim](https://github.com/LazyVim/LazyVim).
Refer to the [documentation](https://lazyvim.github.io/installation) to get started.

# About this fork:

My use-case: I love to work outside, anytime with my smart phone only. So this will take advantage of portrait oriented phablet display, touch screen,...
Plus, this would somewhat synchronize with IdeaVim and Vim for VSCode extension, so I won't have to retrain my muscle memory so often.

# Preferences

- IdeaVim includes some original plugins (surround, exchange, ReplaceWithRegister etc...), I'll try to keep the original behavior (keymapping) of these plugins as much as possible. Sometimes LazyVim's default also have to be overridden to honor this rule.
- For IdeaVim: try to map Idea's actions to equivalent mapping of LazyVim. I'll include a copy of my .ideavimrc in this repo for reference.
